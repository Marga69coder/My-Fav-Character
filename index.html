    <p> Elon Reeve Musk FRS (born June 28, 1971) is an entrepreneur and business magnate. He is the founder, CEO, and Chief Engineer at SpaceX; early stage investor,[note 1] CEO, and Product Architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company; and co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI. A centibillionaire, Musk is one of the richest people in the world. Elon Musk is my favourite charcter as well as one of my inspirations because he built tesla which is a car that has a auto-pilot feature and it looks damn cool. I also want to build and programme a very big project like him. He is an entrepreneur which makes him even cooler. In the past few years he has been rising on top the charts for being one th erichest man. Its my dream to do business on programming and change the world with a little touch of technology. He inspired me and one I hope I also inspire people and young kids just like him. Thank you  </p>
